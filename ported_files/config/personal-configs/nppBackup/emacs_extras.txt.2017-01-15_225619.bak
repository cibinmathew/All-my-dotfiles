TODO:
Select last yanked text

This is a pretty useful shotcut I’ve on my .vimrc that selects the last pasted (yanked) text:

nnoremap <leader>V `[v`]
Thanks to the comment by delexi I know that the function in Emacs is called exchange-point-and-markwhich defaults to C-x C-x but I’ve remapped to leader-V with:

(evil-leader/set-key "V" 'exchange-point-and-mark)
